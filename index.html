                        <!-- Value Offer -->
                        <p>We want to define an alternative calendar with 13 fixed months of 28 days, taking up the previous proposals on this subject and making additional changes in the definition of these.</p>
                        <p>We believe that a positive impact can be had by using a calendar of 13 fixed months of 28 days, better calculations can be made in the planning and the comparison of different activities month by month.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays, we often compare the activities that occurred during a month with the activities of the previous month, but there are multiple variables related to the current calendar model. mainly because the periods vary between 28, 30 and 31 days, but also because the months can have 5 Sundays, or 5 Mondays, which makes the periods not comparable. (February is 90% of what January is, in number of days).</p>
                        <p>It may be convenient to enter measurements in 28-day periods, but this is not something that happens frequently. budgets are defined once a month, payments occur once a month and there are many other activities that are tied to the concept of the month.</p>
                        <h2>What about months names?</h2>
                        <p>We have a calendar that was defined quite some time ago, but we feel that adjustments are required. I personally do not share the idea that we have a month called July, as a "tribute" to the Roman politician Julius Caesar and also another month called "August" after his grandson? the first Roman emperor. So in addition to the need to redefine the calendar so that the months have the same number of yeses, I also propose to redefine the name we use to refer to the months.</p>
